Priconne Re: TL is an unofficial English UI patch for [Cygames' Princess Connect Re: Dive JP](https://dmg.priconne-redive.jp/). Project's main focus is translating the game's user interface into English so non-Japanese people can play it easier. Any help and contributions are welcome!

It is recommended to delete the old patch files instead of just replacing them
Delete the old `BepInEx` folder then extract the zip files again.

## ![Maho](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/princess-connect/images/a/a7/Maho_Box_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/40?cb=20190925080932) UNINSTALLATION

Simply delete patch files that were extracted to the `priconner` folder
No Priconne files that were modified or damaged while installing this patch so you can simply delete them manually. Your game will turn back to a vanilla state.

Files that must delete for uninstalling were:
```
BepInEx
dotnet
changelog.txt
doorstop_config.ini
winhttp.dll
.doorstop_version
```

The Vanilla state of the priconner folder was like the below picture:

  - Priconne Re: TL uses a dedicated framework based on [BepInEx Bleeding Edge](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) as the framework and uses a dedicated plugin based on [bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator). Configurations of both are available too!
    - [BepInEx Config](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/configuration.html)
    - [AutoTranslator Config](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator#configuration)
  - Priconne Re: TL also included Full Screenizer based on [FineBrewDev/BepInEx.FullScreenizer](https://github.com/FineBrewDev/BepInEx.FullScreenizer). You can press F4 to toggle fullscreen
  - Priconne Re: TL uses a 16:9 aspect ratio and can maximize or adjust client sizes larger than 720p for a better experience on the modern monitor resolution.
  - Priconne Re: TL uses 2 strategies on textures based on size for Atlases and Name for others else, it will auto revert when textures are changed and unusable. unfortunately, AMD GPU users need to replace atlas textures due to different compressing sizes.
