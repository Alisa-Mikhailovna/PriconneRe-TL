基本から学んでやるわ！=I'll learn from the basics!
今まで独学で魔法の勉強してたから、学校で習うって変な感じね。\n基本の型とか魔法理論とか興味なかったけど、勉強したら面白いわ。\nふふ、この学園であたしの魔法、もっと磨かれちゃうかもね♪=I've been studying magic on my own up until now, so it feels weird to learn it at school. I wasn't interested in basic forms or magic theory, but it'll be interesting if I study. Haha, my magic might be polished even more at this school♪

待ち合わせは校門前で=We were supposed to meet in front of the school gate
あんた今日の放課後ヒマ？　参考書欲しいから、買い物付き合ってよ。\nお礼はそうね、お揃いの消しゴムでも買ってやるわ！\nじゃ、校門前で待ってるからね！　遅れたらぶっ殺すわよ！=Are you free after school today? I need a reference book, so come shopping with me. I'll buy you a matching eraser as thanks! See you at the school gate! If you're late, I'm going to kill you!
