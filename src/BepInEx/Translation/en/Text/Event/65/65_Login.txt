月下に詠う=Under the Moonlight
魔法でひと工夫=Magic with a little twist
幽霊の出やすい季節=Ghost-Prone Season
夏は幽霊の出やすい季節ですから、\nこういった場所で霊障が相次ぐのも無理はありません。\n……が、正直もっと過ごしやすい季節に出ていただきたいものです。=Summer is the season when ghosts are more likely to appear, so it's not surprising that there are many spiritual disturbances in places like this. However, to be honest, it would be better if they appeared during a more comfortable season.
